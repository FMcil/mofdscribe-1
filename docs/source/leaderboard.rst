Contributing 
------------------

You want your model to appear here? Then 

1. Run the :code:`bench` method for the task you want to contribute to.
2. Create a pull request with the `json` file produced by the :code:`bench` method and fill the pull request template. 

If you have a general-purpose model you might be interested in also submitting it to the `matbench <https://matbench.materialsproject.org>`_ leaderboard. We're currently investigating how to integrate the leaderboard into the matbench project.
